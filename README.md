Question 3
You are given a dataset of customers' annual income and their spending scores in a mall. Your goal is
to perform k-means clustering to segment customers based on their income and spending behavior.
You have the following data:
Customer Annual Income ($1000) Spending Score (1-100)
A 40 60
B 60 50
C 30 80
D 70 20
E 80 10
F 20 90
G 50 45
H 10 95
Develop Code and Perform k-means clustering on this dataset with k = 3 and answer the following:
a) Initialize three initial cluster centroids randomly.
b) Assign each customer to the nearest cluster based on the Euclidean distance.
c) Recalculate the cluster centroids.
d) Repeat the assignment and recalculation steps until convergence.
e) Provide the final cluster assignments and cluster centroids.

Question 2
You are working with a dataset that contains information about different types of animals based on
two features: height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms). You want to use the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify animals into two categories: "Mammals" and "Reptiles." You
have the following extended training dataset:
Animal Height (cm) Weight (kg) Category
A 45 4 Mammal
B 32 1 Reptile
C 22 0.5 Reptile
D 38 3 Mammal
E 60 7 Mammal
F 18 0.3 Reptile
G 50 5 Mammal
H 28 1.5 Mammal
I 40 4 Mammal
J 20 0.6 Reptile
Using the k-NN algorithm with k = 4, perform the following tasks:
Develop Program which can
a) Calculate the Euclidean distance between the test animal (height: 35 cm, weight: 2.5 kg) and each
data point.
b) Determine the k-nearest neighbours for the test animal.
c) Predict the category for the test animal based on the majority category among its k-nearest
neighbours.

Question 1
Suppose you are analyzing the relationship between the sales of a product and two independent
variables: advertising expenditure (in thousands of dollars) and the number of salespeople involved.
You have collected the following data:
Advertising ($x_1$) Salespeople ($x_2$) Sales ($y$)
8 6 120
5 3 75
10 8 145
12 5 130
7 4 100
15 7 130
13 9 110
19 9 150
Perform a Multiple Linear Regression analysis using Python and answer the following:
Write Code (in Java or Python)
a) Which can generate equation of the regression plane?
b) Interpret the coefficients of the independent variables.
c) Calculate the R-squared value.
d) Predict the sales when advertising expenditure is $9,000 and there are 7 salespeople
